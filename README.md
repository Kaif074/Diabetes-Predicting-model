🔬 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
A mini project developed as part of the curriculum at Bangalore Technological Institute, under the Department of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. This web-based application helps predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical input parameters using a trained machine learning model.


💡 Project Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes using a machine learning model trained on a medical dataset. The user inputs several health-related parameters, and the model returns a prediction indicating the likelihood of diabetes.
The final product is a Flask web app with a user-friendly frontend interface, allowing real-time predictions.
🧠 ML Model Details
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression (can be upgraded to Random Forest, SVM, etc. depending on accuracy)
Dataset: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
Features Used:
Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Model Accuracy: ~85% (can vary based on final preprocessing and model tuning)
The model is trained, saved using pickle, and loaded by the Flask backend for real-time prediction.
